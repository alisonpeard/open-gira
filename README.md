# OpenStreetMap / Aqueduct Flood exposure

Use `nismod/snail` to demonstrate infrastructure network intersections with hazards as an
exposure calculation.

Goals: 
- automated pipeline for reproducible exposure analysis anywhere in the world.
- map of a large area showing exposure at different return periods
- charts/stats of exposure per admin region (by road/rail) per hazard type, scenario, epoch
