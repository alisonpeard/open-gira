## open-gira

open-gira is designed to combine infrastructure information with hazard information to
produce an estimate of the risk those hazards pose to that infrastructure.

For example, we can use open-gira to analyse open data on roads, railways, and river flooding,
or electricity transmission lines and tropical cyclones.
