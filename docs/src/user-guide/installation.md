# Installation

This guide will help you to install `open-gira` on your computer.

`open-gira` relies on several tools, some of which are complex to install. The installation
process may take a while.

## Notes

If you are trying to install on [Windows](./installation/open-gira/win.md), use Windows Subsystems for Linux (WSL).

Users familiar with Docker may wish to use the Docker install options to simplify the process.

## Tests

Once everything is installed, run the tests to ensure everything is linked up properly:

```
python -m pytest tests
```
