# STORM tropical cyclone data

The constant-climate synthetic cyclone storm data is used to simulate storms on the power network. More details on the generated data can be found in the paper "Generation of a global synthetic tropical cyclone hazard dataset using STORM" by N. Bloemendaal, I. D. Haigh, H. de Moel, S. Muis, R. J. Haarsma & C. J. H. Jeroen from 2020 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0381-2).

The climate-changing synthetic cyclone storm data is used to simulate storms on the power network where climate changes are taken into account in the storm generation over the span of years. There are four General Circulation Model choices:
 - CMCC-CM2-VHR4
 - CNRM-CM6-1-HR
 - EC-Earth3P-HR
 - HAdGEM3-GC31-HM

For more details on these models see "Impact of Model Resolution on Tropical Cyclone Simulation Using the HighResMIPâ€“PRIMAVERA Multimodel Ensemble, Journal of Climate" by M. J., Camp et al. from 2020.

The data is split into 6 basins:
 - EP: East Pacific
 - NA: North Atlantic
 - NI: North Indian
 - SI: South Indian
 - SP: South Pacific
 - WP: West Pacific
