# Workflow

All of the work that `open-gira` does is encoded in a workflow that can be run by the tool
[`snakemake`](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

There are currently two main strands of analysis, which may be reorganised in the future to be more consistent and extended to include other infrastructure networks and other hazards.

[Transport - flooding](transport-flooding.md)

[Electricity grid - tropical cyclone](cyclone-grid.md)
