# Empirical affected country pair matrix


The empirical affected country pair matrix generation
provides two plots:
- Empirical fraction of a storm hitting both countries given it hits one of them
- Given country A is hit, what is the likelihood also B is hit

Examples for both are given respectively:
![Empirical fraction of a storm hitting both countries given it hits one of them](../power_img/Empirical%20fraction%20of%20a%20storm%20hitting%20both%20countries%20given%20it%20hits%20one%20of%20them.png)
![Given country A is hit, what is the likelihood also B is hit](../power_img/Given%20country%20A%20is%20hit,%20what%20is%20the%20likelihood%20also%20B%20is%20hit.png)

These files are found in `results/power_output/statistics/empirical`.

These two files can be generated (simultaneously) through the `analyse_country_matrix` rule.
