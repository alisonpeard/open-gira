# Gridfinder data

The gridfinder data is obtained from https://gridfinder.org/ and is a map of predicted global power networks. The prediction is generated through applications of state-of-the-art algorithms on night satellite imagery. Due to lack of consistent global data, this is a rather suitable alternative with a high accuracy. Further details on the methods, algorithms and accuracy can be found in the paper 'Predictive mapping of the global power system using open data' by C. Arderne, C. Zorn, C. Nicolas & E. E. Koks from 2020 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0347-4).
