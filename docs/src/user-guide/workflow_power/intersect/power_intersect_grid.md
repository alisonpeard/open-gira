# Unit generation

A unit is defined as a rectangular-shaped geometric area in which the wind speed parameters during a storm are assumed to be
the same throughout the area. Units not containing power network infrastructure are discarded as they will never contain any storm damages.
The size of the unit is currently set to be equal to the [return period map data](../download/power_download_stormtracks.md).
This is deemed to be a suitable granularity and also could allow for future comparisons (not currently implemented). The
figure below shows an example of units around the southern USA/Caribbean which belongs to the North American (NA) region basin.
