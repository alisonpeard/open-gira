# Missing country data

Some .tif [population data](../download/power_download_population.md) files are not available or do not exist for 
certain countries or, often, overseas territories. This is documented through this script and output as 
`results/power_process/exclude_countries.txt`. Examples often include South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, 
Svalbard and Jan Mayen and the Cocos Islands. This data is then used in the [target processing workflow](power_process_targets.md).
