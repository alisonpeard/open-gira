"""
Snakemake file for open-gira.
Snakemake is a workflow organiser. Snakemake is given a list of desired output files
(see rule all below), and if those files don't exist (or aren't up to date), for each
of those files it looks for a rule that can be used to generate it. The process is
then repeated for that rule -- if the files required to build _these files_ don't exist,
look for a rule that will produce them -- and so on.
The Snakemake workflow is covered in detail in the documentation.
